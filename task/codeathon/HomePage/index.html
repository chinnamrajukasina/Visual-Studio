            <h2>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it
                inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or
                sending it information that triggers a crash. In both instances, the DoS attack deprives legitimate
                users (i.e. employees, members, or account holders) of the service or resource they expected.</p>
            <p>There are two general methods of DoS attacks: flooding services or crashing services. Flood attacks occur
                when the system receives too much traffic for the server to buffer, causing them to slow down and
                eventually stop. Popular flood attacks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Buffer overflow attacks </b>the most common DoS attack. The concept is to send more traffic to a
                    network address than the programmers have built the system to handle. It includes the attacks listed
                    below, in addition to others that are designed to exploit bugs specific to certain applications or
                    networks</li>
                <li><b>ICMP flood </b>leverages misconfigured network devices by sending spoofed packets that ping every
                    computer on the targeted network, instead of just one specific machine. The network is then
                    triggered to amplify the traffic. This attack is also known as the smurf attack or ping of death.
                </li>
                <li><b>SYN flood</b>sends a request to connect to a server, but never completes the handshake. Continues
                    until all open ports are saturated with requests and none are available for legitimate users to
                    connect to.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>DNS Attack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A Domain Name System (DNS) attack is where cyber-criminals exploit vulnerabilities found in the Domain
                Name System (DNS) of a server. The purpose of the domain name system is to translate user-friendly
                domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, via a DNS resolver.</p>
            <p>The DNS resolver will first query its own local cache for the domain name and IP address. If it fails to
                locate the records, it will continue to query other DNS servers. Failing that, it will look for the DNS
                server that contains the canonical mapping of the domain.</p>
            <h4>Types of DNS Attack</h4>
            <p>There are many different types of DNS attacks, whose purpose is to exploit vulnerabilities found in the
                three types of DNS servers. These include the DNS stub resolver server, DNS recursive resolver server,
                and DNS authoritative server.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Zero-day attack: </b>This is where the attacker exploits DNS software vulnerabilities that were
                    previously unknown to the victims.</li>
                <li><b>Cache poisoning:</b>Cache poisoning is where the attacker tricks DNS resolvers into caching false
                    information, such as IP addresses, in an attempt to redirect traffic to a malicious website.</li>
                <li><b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):</b> This is where an attacker floods a DNS server with
                    traffic in order to cause disruption and make it unavailable to its intended users. Unlike a simple
                    Denial of Service (DoS) attack which sends traffic from a single device, a DDoS attack will use a
                    botnet, which usually involves compromising random devices on different networks, in order to send
                    large amounts of distributed traffic to the target server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Malware Attacks</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Malware attacks involve the use of malicious software to compromise systems, steal data, or disrupt
                normal operations. Types of malware include viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.</p>
            <p>Attackers often deliver malware through email attachments, infected websites, or compromised software.
                Once installed, malware can execute various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive
                information, encrypting files for ransom, or turning infected machines into bots for further attacks.

            <h2>Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts and potentially alters the
                communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can lead to unauthorized access to
                sensitive information.</p>
            <p>Common MITM techniques include packet sniffing, session hijacking, and DNS spoofing. Attackers may target
                public Wi-Fi networks, compromising routers, or exploiting vulnerabilities in communication protocols to
                carry out MITM attacks.</p>

        <div class="info" id="info-5">
            <h2>Phishing Attack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Phishing attacks involve tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as login
                credentials or financial details, by posing as a trustworthy entity. Phishing can occur through emails,
                messages, or fake websites.</p>
            <p>Attackers often use social engineering tactics to create convincing messages that prompt victims to click
                on malicious links or provide sensitive information. Awareness and caution are crucial to avoid falling
                victim to phishing attacks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info" id="info-6">
            <h2>Spear Phishing Attack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers tailor their messages to specific
                individuals or organizations. The goal is to deceive recipients into taking actions that benefit the
                attacker, such as revealing confidential information or executing malware.</p>
            <p>Spear phishing often involves extensive research on the target, making the deceptive messages more
                convincing. It is a sophisticated form of social engineering that requires vigilance to detect and
                prevent.</p>

            <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that targets the vulnerability in a web application's database
                layer. Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields, exploiting poorly sanitized user inputs to
                manipulate the database.</p>
            <p>The consequences of successful SQL injection can include unauthorized access to sensitive data, data
                manipulation, and potentially the compromise of the entire database. Preventing SQL injection involves
                using parameterized queries and input validation.</p>
